## Project Objective
The objective of this project is to analyze Blinkit’s sales performance data and build an interactive Excel dashboard that provides key business insights into sales trends, product categories, outlet performance, and customer preferences. The goal is to support data-driven decision-making for improving sales strategies, product demand forecasting, and outlet management.

## Final Conclusion

The analysis reveals that Regular fat items and Supermarket Type 3 outlets are the key revenue drivers for Blinkit. Medium-sized outlets and Tier 3 locations show strong sales performance, suggesting potential growth opportunities in these areas. By focusing on high-performing categories like Snacks and Fruits, Blinkit can optimize inventory, improve product availability, and boost overall sales.
